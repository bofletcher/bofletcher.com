            <br></br>
            I have over 3 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked for startups and as a freelancer. While I am a proficient web developer, my expertise is based in problem solving and learning new technologies.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I enjoy building things. I love engineering and seeing projects through to their completion. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I am looking for a challenging role to expand my abilities as a software engineer and as a person.
